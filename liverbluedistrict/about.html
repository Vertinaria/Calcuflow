		<p>Liverblue District (or Calculfow: Chemistry) is a chemistry personification original character project made by Vertin (also known as Vertinaria, Voyagercat, or some other names), it was created on 24 February 2023 as a variant/continuation of my science personification series.</p>
		<p>Storywise, Liverblue District is a district that is a sort of its own dimension, made by the avlikas (Calvin, Bertha, Athanasia, etc.) for the chosen elements from Particle Terrain (each of 94+ different types) to participate in the creating and organising The Universe/Multiverse, on the other side they're just living their life normally in the district, or chaotically.</p>
