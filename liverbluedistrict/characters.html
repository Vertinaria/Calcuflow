						<p><i>"I mayhaps just forgot about what I was going to do with this glass of water."</i></p>
						<p>The main character! One of the creators of The Universe. She's energetic and always excited for new things in her life, sometimes she gets so excited that she accidentally destroys the objects around her. She is observant and curious about her surroundings, wanting to know more about why her friends and other Liverblueians behave in such way. Lastly and unfortunately, she's forgetful.</p>

						<p><i>"Remember, forcing things out only makes things worse."</i></p>
						<p>The other creator of The Universe. Wise balloon guy with a sunny smile. Barely interacts with most people outside his friend group unless necessary, most of the time he spends time meditating in his room, and he avoids dramas at all cost. His philosophy may be weird-sounding to those who do not get it.</p>

						<p><i>"Who broke my battery!? ANSWER NOW!"</i></p>
						<p>A short-tempered battery store owner. She is straightforward and brutally honest, there's no wishy-washy business with her. Besides that, she's very generous, she almost has no sense of belonging, maybe she even wants to get rid of her belongings whenever possible, so she often gives out free stuff, especially batteries. She's that one mom friend that is good at comforting to those who are genuinely kind.</p>

						<p>A gardener that is always anxious, ill, and shaking most of the time so he has Zhesheng as his caretaker. His biggest fear is if anything bad happens to his garden, which led to him overchecking it, and added with his delusions (such as feeling like there's someone in the garden even though there isn't) it doesn't help at all. His other fears is messing up social interactions, so he's the type of guy that is afraid to say no, which makes things awkward sometimes.

She will never stop questioning why RAs are so hated despite being pretty much a normal element-being until it is completely solved, it just doesn't make any sense for her.

						<p><i>"Ok."</i></p>
						<p>Ruslana is one of the noble metals and a writer who mainly writes about articles which look serious like she is. She barely shows any expressions and she's the kind of person that doesn't want to do that many unnecessary things and prefers to focus on whatever she's on. She wouldn't hesitate to ignore people if they're being too much of a distraction, she's only here for serious business.</p>

						<p>Rhiannon is one of the noble metals, he is pretty smart in general but awfully stupid in romantic life. He is the second most handsome guy in the district that is full of blinding sparkles. He falls in love very easily, sometimes it makes you wonder why a glamorous guy like him would be romantically interested in a mid or even horrendous person personality-wise, he really needs to be stopped really hard sometimes because his basic logic just cannot work sometimes, his main love interest is Ruslana though. When not doing anything romantic he does jewellery and gardening roses.</p>

They are meticulous and make sure every detail they have gathered can get into use in the strategies they make. Does Plautilla care? Nope, she ended up thinking her poorly thought-out strategies are better.</p>

						<p>One of the members of the heavy metals. An aggressive artist that will trash on you if they see you getting good things happening in your life, especially for being "effortless", mostly just projecting their own jealousy as a result of getting constantly bullied somewhere in the past for... being kind as a toxic element, so they gave up on being kind. Nickel's one of the people who is nice to them despite Cadmium's awful attitude, because he knows Cad isn't inherently evil.</p>

One problem is that they're addicted to the games on their phone, and the amount of procrastination they do is just unbelievable, so the only way is forcing them to get back to work.</p>

						<p><i>"You're under arrest."</i></p>
						<p>A police that has zero passion towards his job but still keeps it going for whatever reasons. And his stance is pretty unclear, sometimes he sides with the good Liverbluians and sometimes he commits crimes with Asa, though he never gets caught since he's skilled at stealthing. The reason for his unclear stance is because deep down he is just scared of being alone so he is a sort of people-pleaser. Some are aware that he is like this, and when they point that out he'll get irritated, he's having a denial about it.</p>

Besides being the "weird" guy, he is overall a cool guy with a cool appearance, cool flaws, and all that. Aaaaand he sleeps a lot.</p>
