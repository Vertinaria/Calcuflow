				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Liverblue District (also known as Calcuflow: Chemistry or Calcuflow 2) is a Calcuflow subproject about the personified elements of the periodic table with their drama and stupidity, like its name, it takes place on a district named "Liverblue", where the chosen ones from The Particle Terrain resides at.</p>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>Created on 2023 because I wanted to try personifying the other types of science after astronomy, so this is it. Originally they were more strictly scientifically accurate, no fictional places like Liverblue District or Particle Terrain, now they're more casual and less science-heavy. Oh, and fun fact, Oxford/Oxygen was the first character to be created for this project.</p>
